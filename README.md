# KNN-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-
we have 2 datasets.The Titanic data set and the dataset based on considering if an email is a spam or not. first use the KNN model classifier to predict if a passenger survived during the titanic or not. on the second data set Naive Bayes Classifier was used to determine if an email is a spam or not

# Set up and installation requirements
All you need to run this code is a browser with access to Google CoLab or alternatively Jupyter Notebook can be used.Both tools are for data preparation and analysis. For data manipulation the Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn, scipy and Sklearn libraries should be imported.

The dataset for the first project can be found on these links: https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv, https://archive.org/download/test1_202002/test%20%281%29.csv

The dataset for the second project can be found on this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
